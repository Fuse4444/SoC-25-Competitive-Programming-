The file format is defined as follows:
- `wX` refers to **Week X** (e.g., `w1` = Week 1)
- `qY` refers to **Question Y** of that week (e.g., `q1` = Question 1)

Each file contains the C++ solution to a competetiveprogramming question. The links to the original questions can be accessed by clicking the names.

#### Week 1 – Basics and Foundations
Covers essential programming skills including input/output, numerical operations, time complexity analysis, basic sorting, and fundamental data structures. Based primarily on Chapter 1–4 of the *Competitive Programmer's Handbook*. Perfect for beginners establishing a solid C++ and algorithmic foundation.

#### Week 2 – Sorting and Classic Techniques
Focuses on efficient sorting algorithms, STL usage, and core problem-solving paradigms like binary search, sliding window, two pointers, and meet-in-the-middle. Draws from Chapters 4, 5, and 8 of *Guide to Competitive Programming* and advanced sorting ideas from CPH.
