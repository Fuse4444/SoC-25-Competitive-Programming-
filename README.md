# SoC-25-Competitive-Programming

The file format is defined as follows:
- `wX` refers to **Week X** (e.g., `w1` = Week 1)
- `qY` refers to **Question Y** of that week (e.g., `q1` = Question 1)

Each file contains the C++ solution to a competetiveprogramming question. The links to the original questions can be accessed by clicking the names.

#### Week 1 – Basics and Foundations
Covers essential programming skills including input/output, numerical operations, time complexity analysis, basic sorting, and fundamental data structures. Based primarily on Chapter 1–4 of the *Competitive Programmer's Handbook*. Perfect for beginners establishing a solid C++ and algorithmic foundation.

#### Week 2 – Sorting and Classic Techniques
Focuses on efficient sorting algorithms, STL usage, and core problem-solving paradigms like binary search, sliding window, two pointers, and meet-in-the-middle. Draws from Chapters 4, 5, and 8 of *Guide to Competitive Programming* and advanced sorting ideas from CPH.

#### Week 3 – Greedy and Dynamic Programming
Introduces greedy algorithms and classical dynamic programming problems like LIS, grid paths, and knapsack. Emphasizes optimizing decisions over time and building stateful solutions to complex problems. Topics taken from Chapters 6 and 7 of *Competitive Programmer’s Handbook*.
